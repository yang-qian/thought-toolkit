## Overview

This repository consists of two parts: a user-facing component and a researcher-facing component. The user-facing part builds upon and extends the code for the **interface** of [CoAuthor](https://coauthor.stanford.edu). It includes (1) the frontend presented to the users for chatting and/or writing with AI, and (2) the backend that serves requests from the frontend and queries models to generate suggestions. The researcher-facing part enables researchers to easily replay user chatting/writing sessions, analyze chat and writing process logs through multiple lenses (e.g., creativity, cognitive engagement) and at different levels of abstraction (e.g., turn-level, sequence-of-turn-level, conversation level), and group different human-AI interaction processes to annotate and visualize patterns.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to [Qian Yang](https://designai.cis.cornell.edu/) at `qianyang@cornell.edu`.
